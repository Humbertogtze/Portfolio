In this project, I wanted to know if there was any correlation between age, urbanization and the way people voted for the 2016 UK referendum.

The data came separated into districts and I matched it based on postal codes.

For the age column I took the census data, a frequency table, and took the mean age for that district.
For the urbanization, I presumed that population density was a good indicator for urbanization. I simply divided the population by the area of the district in hectares.

The only problem with this project is that Northern Ireland did not submit the referendum results per district, but rather as a country. This should not matter much, I just counted Northern Ireland as a big district.

Finally, I visualized my result into a scatter plot in Tableau.

In conclusion, there seems to be a trend that older and less urbanized areas wanted to exit the EU. Meanwhile younger and more urbanized populations tended to vote to remain.

Correlation does not mean causation, so eachothr should not be taken as the motivs of the other.

In this case, this trend goes along with the fact that older and less urbanized communities are more conservatives.
